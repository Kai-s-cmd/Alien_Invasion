# Alien Invasion

**Alien Invasion** is a 2D arcade-style game where the player takes on the role of a defender of Earth against an alien invasion. 
The player starts with three lives and their goal is to survive for as long as possible while scoring as many points as they can. 
The game features a simple control scheme, where the player moves left and right using the arrow keys and shoots using the space bar. 
The aliens attack in waves, becoming progressively more difficult to defeat as the player progresses.
